DNA Assembly
============

Farmer John has performed DNA sequencing on his prize milk-producing
cow, Bessie DNA sequences are ordered lists (strings) containing
the letters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

As is usual for DNA sequencing, the results are a set of strings
that are sequenced fragments of DNA, not entire DNA strings. A pair
of strings like 'GATTA' and 'TACA' most probably represent the
string 'GATTACA' as the overlapping characters are merged, since
they were probably duplicated in the sequencing process.

Merging a pair of strings requires finding the greatest overlap
between the two and then eliminating it as the two strings are
concatenated together. Overlaps are between the end of one string
and beginning of another string, NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF A STRING.

By way of example, the strings 'GATTACA' and 'TTACA' overlap
completely. On the other hand, the strings 'GATTACA' and 'TTA' have
no overlap at all, since the matching characters of one appear in
the middle of the other, not at one end or the other. Here are some
examples of merging strings, including those with no overlap:

	GATTA + TACA -> GATTACA
	TACA + GATTA -> TACAGATTA
	TACA + ACA -> TACA
	TAC + TACA -> TACA
	ATAC + TACA -> ATACA
	TACA + ACAT -> TACAT

Given a set of N (2 <= N <= 7) DNA sequences all of whose lengths
are in the range 1..7, find and print length of the shortest
possible sequence obtainable by repeatedly merging all N strings
using the procedure described above. All strings must be merged
into the resulting sequence.

PROBLEM NAME: dna2

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer N

* Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains a single DNA subsequence

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
GATTA
TAGG
ATCGA
CGCAT

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Length of the shortest possible string obtained by merging
        the subsequences. It is always possible -- and required -- to
        merge all the input strings to obtain this string.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
13

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Such string is "CGCATCGATTAGG".
